### Selected AI Projects

**1. Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays**
Built a deep learning model to classify chest X-rays as pneumonia or normal, with Grad-CAM heatmaps to interpret and visualize model predictions.

**2. Improving Semi-Supervised Learning under Class Imbalance**  
Developed a hybrid AdaMatch–FlexMatch algorithm using PyTorch.  
→ Improved minority-class accuracy while preserving majority-class performance.

**4. Biomedical Text Classification**  
Compared TF-IDF vs PubMedBERT representations for healthcare text mining.

**5. Information Retrieval System**  
Developed a Python-based search engine using PyTerrier for biomedical abstracts.

**6. COVID-19 Abstract Analysis**
